formats. StarDict, XDXF and dictd formats are supported both as inputs and
outputs, sdict and Lingvo DSL formats as outputs only.  It uses XDXF internally
as an intermediate representation.

To convert a dictionary between dictd and StarDict formats:

   makedict -o stardict file.index

To convert a dictionary between dictd and XDXF formats:

   makedict -o xdxf path/to/file.index

To convert an unencrypted Lingvo dictionary to StarDict format:

   makedict -o stardict path/to/dictionary.dsl
